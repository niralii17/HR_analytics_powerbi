### Dashboard Insights
The HR analytics dashboard delivers critical insights into workforce metrics, including presence percentage, sick leave percentage, and work-from-home (WFH) percentage by date. This tool provides real-time data to facilitate informed decision-making, benefiting both employees and the organization.

### Data Trends (April, May, June)

- April: In April, the data reveals that employees worked from home for 94.05% of the time. Sick leave accounted for 9.08% of the total leave, while other types of leave made up 0.43%. This distribution highlights a significant emphasis on remote work during this period.

- Trend Analysis: The report features trend analysis that tracks and visualizes how these key metrics—work-from-home percentages, sick leave, and other leave types—changed throughout the months of April, May, and June. This analysis provides insights into evolving workforce patterns and helps in understanding shifts in employee leave behavior over these months.
